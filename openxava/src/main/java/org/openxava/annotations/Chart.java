/**
 * To display a chart using the values from a collection. <p>
 * 
 * Applies to collections. <p>
 *
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * &nbsp;@Chart
 * &nbsp;Collection<CorporationEmployee> employees;  
 * </pre>	
 * It could display a chart with several bars, one for each employee, for example.<br>
 * In this case OpenXava tries to determine automatically whose properties identifies each entity, 
 * to use them as labels, and also try to choose numeric values from entities susceptible to be
 * shown in the chart.<br>
 * However, you can determine explicitly what properties use, like in this example:
 * <pre>
 * &nbsp;@Chart(labelProperties = "firstName, lastName", dataProperties = "salary, bonus")
 * &nbsp;Collection<CorporationEmployee> employees;  
 * </pre>
 * In this case the concatenation of firstName and lastName is used as label, and the salary and
 * bonus properties as data.
 * <p>
 * You can also specify the type of chart to use:
 * <pre>
 * &nbsp;@Chart(type = ChartType.LINE, labelProperties = "month", dataProperties = "sales")
 * &nbsp;Collection<MonthlySales> sales;  
 * </pre>
 * Available chart types are BAR (default), LINE and PIE.
