          / </span>SSO with Azure AD</h1>
      <a href="http://openxava.org/xavapro"></a><em>All the features in this
        article are available only in <a href="http://openxava.org/xavapro">XavaPro</a></em></div>
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">Since XavaPro 7.1&nbsp; you can
      configure user identification to use Azure AD, allowing you to use <b>Single
        Sign-On</b> (SSO). This way, the user can authenticate once and access
      all your XavaPro applications and other non-XavaPro applications that also
      use Azure AD. Furthermore, using Azure AD enables you to utilize <b>two-step
        authentication</b> for your XavaPro applications. <br>
      <h2><a name="aÃ±adir-dependencias-en-pom.xml">SSO configuration in XavaPro</a></h2>
      In the <i>Admin</i> folder, you have a module called SSO to configure
      Azure AD:<code class="xml"></code> </div>
    <img src="files/sso-module_en.png">
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">If you check the <i>Enabled</i>
      checkbox and fill in the remaining fields with the correct configuration
      of your Azure AD for your application, when you sign in, you will have a
      new button labeled SIGN IN WITH AZURE AD:</div>
    <img src="files/sigin-in-with-azuread_en.png">
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">If the user clicks on SIGN IN WITH
      AZURE AD, he will be given the option to sign in using his Azure
      credentials:</div>
    <img src="files/microsoft-sign-in_en.png" alt="">
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">Furthermore, if the user is
      already signed in on that browser, they will access the application
      without being prompted for authentication. The user needs to be added to
      the application in Azure AD configuration. For versions prior to 7.5, the
      user must also be registered as a XavaPro user in the application with the
      corresponding roles assigned, and the user must be registered in the
      XavaPro application with the same name as in Azure. Starting from version
      7.5, Azure AD users no longer need to be manually registered in XavaPro.
      When an Azure AD user authenticates against the application for the first
      time, if they don't exist in XavaPro, they will be automatically
      registered. If the application has an "azure ad" role defined, this role
      will be automatically assigned to the new user. New organizations created
      from version 7.5 onwards have the "azure ad" role created by default, but
      it can also be created manually if needed.<br>
      <h2>Configure the application in Azure AD</h2>
      If you already use Azure AD in your organization, you will be familiar
      with configuring applications and assigning users to them. You will also
      know where to find the values for the XavaPro SSO form. However, if you
      have never used Azure AD before, don't worry. Here is a guide to help you
      register your application in Azure AD. Azure AD offers a free tier good
      enough to enable SSO in your XavaPro applications. </div>
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">
      <h3>Azure AD Control Panel</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">The first step is to sign up for
      Azure AD at this address: <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/active-directory">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/active-directory</a>
      (if the link doesn't work, search for "Azure AD" on Google). Once you have
      signed up, go to the Azure main page, which is usually accessible after
      you log in. If not, go to <a href="https://portal.azure.com/">https://portal.azure.com/</a>.
      From there, click on <i>Azure Active Directory</i>:</div>
    <img src="files/azure-menu-azure-ad-option_en.png">
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">This takes you to the Azure AD
      administration page:</div>
    <img src="files/azure-ad-dashboard_en.png">
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">
      <h3>Add application in Azure AD</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">Let's assume that we have a
      XavaPro application called <i>invoicing</i> and we want to register it in
      Azure AD. We should follow the next steps.</div>
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">First, open the <i>Add</i> menu
      and click on <i>App registration</i>:</div>
    <img src="files/azure-ad-add-app-registration_en.png">
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">
      <div> In the <i>Register an application page</i> that appears, enter your
        application's registration information:
        <ul>
          <li>In the <i>Name</i> field, enter "invoicing".</li>
          <li>Under <i>Supported account types</i>, select <i>Accounts in this
              organizational directory only</i>.</li>
          <li>In the <i>Redirect URI</i> section, select <i>Web</i> in the
            combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: <i>http://localhost:8080/invoicing/sso/azure/redirect</i></li>
        </ul>
        <img src="files/azure-ad-app-registration-form_en.png">
        <ol>
        </ol>
        Select <i>Register</i> to create the application.
        <ol>
        </ol>
        <h3>Create secret</h3>
        <p>On the Azure AD administration page, choose the <i>App registrations</i>
          option from the left menu. This will display the list of your
          applications. Click on <i>invoicing</i>.</p>
        <img src="files/azure-ad-app-registration-choose-app_en.png">
        <ol>
        </ol>
        In the app's registration screen, click on the <i>Certificates &amp;
          secrets</i> option in the left to open the page where we can generate
        secrets and upload certificates. In the <i>Client secrets</i> section,
        click on <i>New client secret</i>:
        <ol>
        </ol>
        <img src="files/azure-ad-new-client-secret-option_en.png"><br>
        <p>Type a key description (for instance app secret), Select one of the
          available key durations (6 months, 1 year, 2 years, or Never Expires)
          as per your security concerns.</p>
        <ol>
        </ol>
        <img src="files/azure-ad-app-secret-form_en.png">
        <ol>
        </ol>
        <p>The generated key value will be displayed when you click the <i>Add</i>
          button. Copy the generated value for use in the steps later. You'll
          need this key later in your XavaPro SSO configuration. This key value
          will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other
          means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating
          to any other screen or section.</p>
        <ol>
        </ol>
        <img src="files/azure-ad-secret-value_en.png"></div>
      <div>
        <h2>Configure the Azure AD application in XavaPro</h2>
        <p>In Azure AD, go to <i>App registrations</i> and select your
          application to view its essential information. Then, in your XavaPro
          application, open the SSO module within the <i>Admin</i> folder and
          fill in the required information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter the <i>Client id</i> in XavaPro with the <i>Application
              (client)</i> ID from Azure AD.</li>
          <li>In the XavaPro <i>Authority</i> field, add the prefix <i>https://login.microsoftonline.com/</i>
            and append the Azure AD <i>Directory (tenant) ID</i>.</li>
          <li>In the XavaPro <i>Secret</i> field, enter the application secret
            you created in the previous step and have presumably noted down.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this way:</p>
        <img src="files/azure-ad-sso-xavapro-from-azure-conf_en.png">
        <p>Check the <i>Enabled</i> checkbox, and your application will now
          work with Azure AD. Remember to register users in your XavaPro
          application with the corresponding roles; otherwise, it will not work.
          If you do this with other XavaPro applications, you will be able to
          authenticate yourself the first time and access the other applications
          without login. Additionally, you can enable two-step authentication
          for your users from Azure AD.</p>
