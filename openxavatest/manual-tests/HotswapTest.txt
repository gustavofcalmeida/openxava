TMR ME QUEDÉ POR AQUÍ. HACIENDO LO DE ARRIBA, FALTA REVISAR Y PROBAR

* Añadir clases transitoria nueva.
* Adding modules.
	* En el menú al recargar.
	* Al acceder usando la URL.
	
* Probar modificar controladores y módulos con una aplicación en español.
* Changing @View, @Tab, @DescriptionsList, etc.

* Adding new entities. 

* Etiquetas y mensajes. 
* Optimizar para que solo parsee los MetaModels cuando haya cambio. 
* Al entrar en cada módulo desde el menú de la derecha hacer un "Reloading metamodules...". ¿Hace algo duplicado?	
* Modify openxava core and see the changes without reloading.
* Que esté desactivado en producción.
